=========================
Bugs that we need to fix:
=========================

- Nonetype object has no attribute "_getitem_" when clicking on Draw Something. Happens sometimes. When switch account, does not happen.
  - [Problem: Check logic on getexistingmatch.]

- No display message when there are no matches to be judged.

- View previous matches does not work.

- Going back may cause you to challege yourself.
  -[Potential fix: Check that the user that matched up does not have the same id.]

- Can judge your own games.
  - [Potential fix: check match for user ID matching the current user logged in]

- Judging shouldn't display username.
  - [Note: change this after fixing previous bugs]
