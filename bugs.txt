=========================
Bugs that we need to fix:
=========================

- Nonetype object has no attribute "_getitem_" when clicking on Draw Something. Happens sometimes. When switch account, does not happen

- No display message when there are no matches to be judged.

- View previous matches does not work.

- Going back may cause you to challege yourself. [Potential fix: Check that the user that matched up does not have the same id.

- Can judge your own games. [Potential fix: check match for user ID matching the current user logged in]

- Judging shouldn't display username. [Note: change this after fixing previous bugs]
