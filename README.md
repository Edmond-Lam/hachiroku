*Get drawing!* Team Team Shariar presents Kakukaku!! (カクカク！！), a website that hosts a platform for competitive, creative drawing. You can choose to play as a drawer or a judge. Two drawers are randomly matched against each other to submit a drawing based on some category or word with limited time. A random participating judge is then picked to select a winner. 

A rank system is also implemented to rate the skills of each drawer—you will gain or lose points based on your performance. You can also view your match history.
